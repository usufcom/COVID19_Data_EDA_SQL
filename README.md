# COVID19_Data_EDA_SQL
## Preforming COVID19 Data EDA in SQL

#### Description:

This repository contains SQL code designed for data analysis and reporting related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the code I extract, transform, and analyse data related to COVID-19, focusing on various aspects, such as population statistics, infection rates, and vaccination coverage. I also prepare data for visualization for further analysis and reporting.

The code focuses on various aspects of COVID-19 data, including population statistics, infection rates, and vaccination coverage. 

It performs the following key operations:

- Data retrieval from the "worldcovid" and "world_demo" tables.
- Calculation of total population and data modification.
- Analysis of COVID-19 data, including death percentages and infection rates.
- Continental-level analysis.
- Calculation of global statistics.
- Analysis of COVID-19 vaccination data and calculation of population vaccination percentages.

The code also prepares data for visualization. It can serve as a starting point for in-depth data analysis and reporting related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Please refer to the code comments for a more detailed explanation of each SQL query and its purpose.
